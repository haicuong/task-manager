## Code Quality

The project uses ESLint and TypeScript to maintain consistent code quality and catch type errors during development.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture:

- **Table Management**: Core table logic handles task storage and rendering
- **Event System**: Centralized event manager handles user interactions
- **Storage Layer**: Async storage provides persistent data management
- **UI Components**: Separate modules handle different features such as filtering and sorting

## Future Enhancements (Not planned)

Potential improvements:

- User authentication and cloud sync
- Task categories and tags
- Recurring tasks
- Task notifications
- Export/import functionality
- Collaborative task sharing
